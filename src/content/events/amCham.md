# AmCham EU Annual Report 2021. A Year of challenges.

History will surely look back upon 2021 as the year that humanity fought back against the novel COVID-19 coronavirus. From the outset of the year, AmCham EU identified contributing to Europe’s economic recovery as a top priority. We supported the EU’s goals of placing at its centre the twin transitions of building more digital and sustainable economic models all while advocating for international alignment. Throughout the year AmCham EU continued to advocate for a stronger, more competitive and united EU, while positioning US business as a centrepiece of the EU’s economic prosperity. Our 2021 annual report provides a snapshot of how AmCham EU continues to be the best representative for US business committed to and invested in Europe.
