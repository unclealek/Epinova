### S&C Business Development is here to assist you to accomplish your objectives for growth.

International Strategic Collaborations are an integral part of the undertakings by S&C Business Development. Through these formal and informal relationships, liaisons will naturally develop which will add to the regions' ability to advance its business and academic sectors, while attracting investment from elsewhere. Such a formal AND grassroots approach is more certain to ensure growth in a timely and fiscally responsible manner. S&C already has a solid track record of initiating activities between North America and the Nordics (including regional MOUs) and is currently also working within the E.U. We work with stakeholders within the Private and Public Sectors and encourage working relationships, as all will benefit. Our networks and working relationships are extensive.
