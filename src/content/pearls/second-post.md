# *"Most opportunities do not directly present themselves."*

They either need to be actively sought after or configured with what is available.

 Being proactive and searching for creative solutions will surely set you apart from much of the potential competition. 

Many of these unique opportunities tend to occur within the least expected of places and conversations, and often include those who were not part of your original target. 

### Entering the North American Market

When considering entering the **North American market**, contemplate searching out the:
- Often overlooked locations
- Unexplored industries
- Underserved populations

### Our Approach

At **S&C Business Development**, we recognize the importance of:
- Being creative
- Having clear purpose
- Leveraging local funding and support

> This is engrained in our methods of operation. (S&C = Search & Connect)
> 
> This is why **we are able to provide our clients up and beyond their initial expectations**.

### The Frontier Trails Initiative

We launched the **Frontier Trails initiative** with a clear mission:
- Connecting the overlooked and often undervalued
- Enabling mutual growth opportunities
- Creating pathways for collaborative success

*Eventually opportunistic decision makers will take notice and there will be plenty of mutual benefit to go around.*
